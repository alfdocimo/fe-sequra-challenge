# Pay in instalments widget

This project is a React-based widget that displays installment options for a given product on a merchant's website. The widget is designed to be easily embeddable on third-party sites and updates dynamically when the product price changes.

## Tech Stack

ðŸ”µ **Vite** â€“ Provides out-of-the-box support for common web patterns/frameworks

ðŸ”µ **TypeScript** â€“ TypeSafety enables us to build, refactor, and ship faster with fewer bugs.

ðŸ”µ **Playwright** â€“ End-to-end testing

ðŸ”µ **Vitest** â€“ Testing framework

ðŸ”µ **React Testing Library** â€“ React Component testing

ðŸ”µ **JSDOM** â€“ Simulated browser environment for tests

## Getting started

ðŸ‘‰ Install the dependencies

```sh
pnpm i
```

ðŸ‘‰ Initialize mock service worker in our `public` dir

```sh
npx msw init
```

ðŸ‘‰ Starting the development server

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

ðŸ‘‰ Running our e2e tests with `playwright`

```sh
pnpm run test:e2e
```

ðŸ‘‰ Running our integration/unit tests with `vitest`

```sh
pnpm run test
```

## Build our solution for merchant websites

```sh
pnpm run build
```

This will generate our .js and .css files inside of `/dist`

## Usage in 3rd party websites (Merchants)

To integrate the widget into a merchant site, add the bundled script to the target webpage, along with its styles:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="/path-to-widget/pay-in-instalments-widget/dist/pay-in-instalments-widget.css"
/>
<script src="/path-to-widget/pay-in-instalments-widget/dist/pay-in-instalments-widget.js"></script>

<script>
  // 1. Wait until DOMContent is loaded
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    // 2. Create a Widget instance
    const payInInstalmentsWidget = new PayInInstalmentsWidget();
    window.payInInstalmentsWidget = payInInstalmentsWidget;

    // 3. Locate the element that will act as the wrapper upon which it will be mounted
    const $widgetContainer = document.getElementById(
      "pay-in-instalments-widget-container"
    );
    const initialPrice = 39900;

    // 4. Mount the widget
    payInInstalmentsWidget.mount($widgetContainer, initialPrice);
  });
</script>
```

## Structure

The following repo uses an ad-hoc version of [Feature Slice Design](https://feature-sliced.design/)

As we are not using `pages` but rather working inside of `widget` when creating new functionalities
